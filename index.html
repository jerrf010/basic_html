        <h2>What is Github?</h2>
        <p>Github is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. 
        It allows developers to host and manage their code repositories, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.
         Github provides features such as branching, pull requests, and issue tracking, making it easier for teams to work 
         together on code. It is widely used in the software development community and has become a popular platform for 
         open-source projects.</p>
